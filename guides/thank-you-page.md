# Thank You Page

A ‘Thank You’ message, or confirmation message, displays after a user fills out your form. A typical success message tells your customers that their message has been sent successfully, and when they’ll receive a response from you.

### To change ‘Thank You’ message

1\. Go to form explorer.

2\. Select the form you want to change confirmation message, click on settings button, and wait for the settings form to load.
