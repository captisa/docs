# Thank You Page

A ‘Thank You,’ or confirmation message, is displayed after a user fills out your form. A typical success message tells your customers that their message has been sent successfully and when they’ll receive a response from you.

### To change the ‘Thank You’ message

1\. Go to form explorer.

2\. Select the form with the confirmation message you want to change, click on the Settings button, and wait for the settings form to load.
