# Form Rules

You can create form rules and recommendations to apply form logic without writing JavaScript code. Form rules provide a simple interface to implement commonly used rules. By combining conditions and actions, you can do the following with form rules:

* Set field value based on formula, value from another field, and constant value
* Clear field values
* Make field required
* Show or hide fields
* Enable or disable fields
* Validate data and show error messages
* Change field instructions

### Create a form rule

1\. Go to form explorer.

2\. Select the form you want to create the form rule for, then click on ‘Rules -> Form Rules’ menu item from the toolbar.
